SafetyNet
==============
SafetyNet is a wireless, multi-user proximity monitoring system. A parent or group chaperone carries a pocket-sized base unit that wirelessly communicates with a secure smartphone/web application and can monitor up to 25 bracelets equipped with wireless remote "check-in" capability.

The concept of a "zone" is central to SafetyNet operation.  A zone consists of a base unit, a smartphone running the SafetyNet app and linked via bluetooth to the base unit, and 1-25 bracelets configured for that zone.
